Staying on music, we speculate why Jack Harlow is deciding to put an album out now with no promo. This leads to a deeper discussion about Doja Cat’s speculative rap album. While they figure out how to shape their careers, Kendrick is in full stride after grossing the highest rap tour. Then we put our conspiracy cap on after Tucker Carlson’s response video. Is he still working with Fox? In sad news we lost a daytime tv legend, Jerry Springer. We reminisce on some of the craziest moments in his show’s history. Like setting up the KKK to get in a fight. Speaking of a set up, Vlad has a new show with Compton Cops and Rory offers an interesting take. Tune in as the guys discuss all of this, as well as, Emmett Till’s accuser finally taking a dirt nap, the Knicks advancing to the second round, + more!",

Weekend 2 at Coachella has finally come to a close (sans Frank) and Latto used her performance to address some beef. Staying on beef, Jim Jones continues to pester Pusha T in a recent interview which prompts a subtle response from Pusha. We continue to reminisce about past beef which moves Rory (pause). Julian drops another random celebrity interaction, while 11-year-old Rory annoyed Benzino at a Miami Heat game.

This past Sunday, Rory, Mal, and Julian went to the Apollo to see Lil Wayne. Rather quickly we learned that Mal really isn’t a Wayne fan (argument ensues). In other disappointing concert news, Frank Ocean left everyone at Coachella upset after many technical problems and turning his set into karaoke. Speaking of karaoke, is it hip-hop for Usher to give 21 Savage a mic to sing? Even worse, is it hip-hop for Rory to DM Drake laughing emojis and never get a response? Friendships tend to come to a close which is also the case for Ja Rule and Billy McFarland. Did you hear about the woman that claimed to have hooked up with 6 guys a day for a week? This leads into a conversation about the double standard between men and women and of course high school bleachers get involved.

Speaking of predatory spaces, Hulu is making a Freaknik doc and aunties across the country are getting ahead of the footage.

Meanwhile, Eddin reunited with Whoreible Decisions and shared Demaris’s rose party, while Julian went to another Knicks game. Needless to say, none of us were at Dreamville. In Raleigh, Drake gave J Cole his flowers and dedicated a song to him so we ask which song the guys would sing for each other. If they’re not up to sing they could always use AI. Did you watch the Women’s National Championship game? Such as most conversations go, this great basketball was overshadowed by a media blitz of racial double standards. Rory brings up an interesting angle that points the finger back at the media as the culprit. Is it tricking if you pay for someone’s divorce? And should it be socially acceptable to micro-dose crack?

Mal shares a difference of opinion on why that deal didn’t work. This leads into comparing the Bey Hive vs. The Barbs, which ultimately turns into a commentary on fan cult culture.

We’ve had a lot of episodes without guests lately (you’re welcome) Everyone shares personal stories of how their relationships/friendships have evolved over the years, as well as how we’ve grown. Anyway, we’re off that deep shit. The second half of this episode we lighten the mood. Julian asks the rest of the team hip-hop trivia. Rory is on a mission to redeem himself after taking an L on this week’s Patreon trivia (subscribe now). We cover questions ranging from Eminem, Tupac, Biggie, Kanye, etc. Please pay attention to Rory’s competitiveness throughout this segment. Trivia ends on a string of Hov questions that leaves Rory and Mal in a battle for the W. Finally, we end with everyone naming the album that had the biggest impact on them. Tune in as the guys discuss all of this + more!",

We then divulge into her personal life and discuss how her high school boyfriend has possibly the biggest of all time. Then we discuss how Bryan Michael Cox’s relationship with LVRN eventually led to him recently taking the role as head of A&R. This leads to a conversation about the landscape of R&B and the history of the remix and Usher’s Confessions. Then we put our guests through rapid fire questions where we pin artists they’ve worked with against each other. Then Justice shares his gripes with Puff, which leads to how everyone shouldn’t have an opinion. We divert from music for a minute to discuss conspiracies.
